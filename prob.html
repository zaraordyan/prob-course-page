  <h1>Probability theory and statistics</h1>

  <h2>About Probability and statistics:</h2>
  <h3>Probability is a theoretical subject used
     to analyse the likelihood of events happening in the future.
     On the other hand, statistics is an applied subject which
     uses probability theory to analyse data which has been 
     collected.Probability and statistics are related in that
     the theories we develop in probability mathematics are
     compared with statistical findings which can tell us more 
     information about the data. We can also use statistics to 
     estimate the probability of something happening in the future.</h3>
